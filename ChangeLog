	* Data/Bitstream/Fusion/Monadic.hs: Adds `MonadFail` to context
	where code uses explicit `fail`.
	* bitstream.cabal: Bump version to 0.3.0.1, adds test success
	cases, adds library dependency to test suites.

2015-03-04  PHO  <pho@cielonegro.org>

	* Data/Bitstream.hs, Data/Bitstream/Lazy.hs: Fix Haddock comments
	mentioning a wrong module name,  Reported by sebastianv89 (#3).

2015-01-15  PHO  <pho@cielonegro.org>

	* bitstream.cabal: Bump version to 0.2.0.4

	* Data/Bitstream/Generic.hs (fromBits) [base >= 4.7]: Require
	FiniteBits not just Bits,  Patch by Liyang HU (#2). This is a
	signature change only for those who with base >= 4.7. base-4.6
	users will not see any changes.

	* Data/Bitstream/Packet.hs: Remove redundant import of Ord(..),
	Patch by Liyang HU (#2).

	* bitstream.cabal (Build-Depends): Relax version constraint on
	QuickCheck from == 2.5.* to >= 2.5,  Patch by Liyang HU (#2).

	* bitstream.cabal: Bump version to 0.2.0.3

	* Unknown: Fix compilation on GHC 7.6 by adding (Integral α) for
	each (Bits α),  Reported by Luca Molari.

	* Unknown: Fix the compilation on GHC 7.4 by adding Show
	constraint where appropriate,  Patch by Jaap ter Woerds.

	* bitstream.cabal: Bump version to 0.2

	* Unknown: Make stream fusion actually work.

	* Unknown: Implement fromBits / toBits

	* Unknown: Strict Bitstreams' bit length should only be a hint,
	just like stream size.

	* Unknown: Strict Bitstreams should keep bit-length maintained.

	* Unknown: Strict bitstrems should use unstreamPackets instead of
	hand-written unfoldr-based unstreamers.
